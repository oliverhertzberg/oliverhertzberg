## 👋 Hi there! My name is Oliver Sebastian Hertzberg

I'm a student at **Hive Helsinki**, part of the 42 Network, where I've been immersed in low-level programming, algorithms, system design, and collaborative software development.

Right now, my team and I are wrapping up our final project, **Transcendence** — a full-stack web application built with **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and **React**. It's been a rewarding challenge and a great capstone to our time at Hive.

### 🔍 What I'm up to:
- 🎯 Actively looking for a **software engineering internship** (Summer–Fall 2025)
- 🐍 Exploring **Python** for backend development and scripting
- 💻 Continuing to build with **React**, **TypeScript**, and modern frontend tools

### 🔧 Skills & Tools:
- Languages: **C**, **C++**
- Systems & Tools: **Linux**, **Docker**, **Git**, **Makefiles**

📫 Feel free to connect, collaborate, or just say hi!
