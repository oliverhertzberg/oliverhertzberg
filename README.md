## 👋 Hi there! My name is Oliver Sebastian Hertzberg

I’m a recent graduate of Hive Helsinki (42 Network), where I immersed myself in low-level programming, algorithms, system design, and collaborative software development.

My capstone project, Transcendence, is a full-stack web application built with TypeScript, Node.js, and React — a rewarding challenge that brought together everything I learned at Hive, from backend logic to frontend UI/UX.

🔍 What I’m up to:

    🎯 Actively seeking a Junior Software Developer role (available immediately)

    💻 📚 Completing the Full Stack Open course by the University of Helsinki (React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, TypeScript)

🔧 Skills & Tools:

    Languages: C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React

    Systems & Tools: Linux, Docker, Git, Makefiles

    Other: SQL, REST APIs, collaborative Git workflows

Always eager to learn, adapt, and tackle challenging problems — whether it’s debugging a tricky algorithm or crafting a clean, responsive UI.

📫 Feel free to connect, collaborate, or just say hi!
